# Understanding Digital Gardens

Digital gardens are personal knowledge bases that are curated and shared publicly. Unlike traditional blogs with chronological posts, digital gardens are living documents that grow and evolve over time.

## Key Aspects of Digital Gardens

1. **Non-linear** - Content doesn't have to follow a strict sequence or timeline
2. **Work in progress** - Gardens are perpetually growing and evolving
3. **Interconnected** - Ideas link to each other, creating a network of thoughts
4. **Personal** - Gardens reflect the gardener's interests and thinking patterns
