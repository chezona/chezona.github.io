# Hello, I'm Chezona

This is my personal space where I document my thoughts, projects, and discoveries. Think of it as my open notebook — always evolving and never quite finished.

<div class="featured-box">
  <div class="box">
    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>Things I'm building and working on right now.</p>
    <a href="projects">Explore Projects →</a>
  </div>
  
  <div class="box">
    <h3>Ideas & Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Concepts, learnings, and reflections on various topics.</p>
    <a href="notes">Browse Notes →</a>
  </div>
  
  <div class="box">
    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>Useful tools and references I've collected along the way.</p>
    <a href="resources">View Resources →</a>

Feel free to wander around. The connections between ideas are often more interesting than the ideas themselves.
