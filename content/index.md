# Hello, This is my Webyard

A small space where I grow and share my thoughts, projects, and discoveries (if any) — always evolving and never quite finished. I am particularly keen on finance, neural nets and filmmaking. 

## Explore My Notes

- [[projects/index|Projects]] — Things I'm building and working on
- [[notes/index|Ideas & Thoughts]] — Concepts, learnings, and reflections
- [[resources/index|Resources]] — Useful tools and references I've collected

Feel free to wander around. The connections between ideas are often more interesting than the ideas themselves.
