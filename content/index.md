# Hello, I'm Chezona

This is my personal space where I document my thoughts, projects, and discoveries. Think of it as my open notebook — always evolving and never quite finished.

## Explore My Notes

- [[projects/index|Projects]] — Things I'm building and working on
- [[notes/index|Ideas & Thoughts]] — Concepts, learnings, and reflections
- [[resources/index|Resources]] — Useful tools and references I've collected

Feel free to wander around. The connections between ideas are often more interesting than the ideas themselves.
