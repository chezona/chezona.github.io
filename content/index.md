# Hello, I'm Chezona

This is my personal space where I document my thoughts, projects, and discoveries. Think of it as my open notebook â€” always evolving and never quite finished.

<div class="featured-box">
  <div class="box">
    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>Explorations, experiments, and creations I'm currently working on. From coding to creative writing, these are my works in progress.</p>
    <a href="projects">Explore Projects</a>

  <div class="box">
    <h3>Ideas & Thoughts</h3>
    <p>A collection of concepts, learnings, and reflections on various topics that have captured my attention and curiosity.</p>
    <a href="notes">Browse Notes</a>
  </div>
  
  <div class="box">
    <h3>Resources</h3>
    <p>Useful tools, references, and materials I've gathered over time. Things I find valuable and worth sharing.</p>

Feel free to wander around. The connections between ideas are often more interesting than the ideas themselves.
